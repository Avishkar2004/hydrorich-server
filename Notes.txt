Q. Where to see Cache Data after hitting Req :-

1. First, let's connect to the Redis CLI inside your running container:

  "docker exec -it hydrorich-redis redis-cli"

Now that you're in the Redis CLI, here are some useful commands to view your cache data:

1. To see all keys in the cache:

KEYS *

 keys *
1) "cache:/api/products"

2. To get the value of a specific key:
GET <key_name>

GET cache:/api/products

3. To see the type of a key:

TYPE <key_name>

4. To see all keys matching a pattern:
KEYS <pattern>

5. To see all members of a set:
SMEMBERS <set_name>

6. To see all elements in a list:
LRANGE <list_name> 0 -1

7. To see all fields and values in a hash:
HGETALL <hash_name>

You can type these commands directly in the Redis CLI prompt (127.0.0.1:6379>). To exit the Redis CLI, you can type exit or press Ctrl+C.
Additionally, if you want to monitor Redis operations in real-time, you can use:
